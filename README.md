# Human_Retention
The project involved meticulous data cleaning, processing, and exploratory analysis to extract meaningful insights from the collected data. Additionally,     I employed advanced machine learning algorithms to build a predictive model capable of identifying employees at risk of leaving the company.
By incorporating the principles of data-driven decision-making, I successfully identified critical factors affecting employee retention and presented actionable strategies to enhance talent management within the organization.
# Outcome
The "Human Retention Project" delivered promising outcomes, showcasing the effectiveness of the decision tree model in predicting employee turnover with an impressive accuracy rate. By utilizing this model, the organization will gain a valuable tool to forecast and identify employees who may consider leaving, enabling timely interventions to mitigate turnover risk.


# Accuracy rate = 97.84%
